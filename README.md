# Murilo Pontes

Senior Embedded / Software Engineer  
Rust • Embedded Linux • Systems Architecture • AI-assisted Systems  
🇵🇹 Portugal | 🌍 Remote / Relocation

I design and build **production-grade embedded systems** where reliability,
hardware constraints, and long-term maintainability matter.

I leverage **AI as an engineering tool** — for automation, analysis,
and decision support — especially in **constrained and real-world environments**.

## Focus

- Embedded Linux (Yocto / Torizon)
- Rust for systems & embedded software
- CAN-bus, MCUs, hardware–software integration
- AI-assisted systems (edge inference, tooling, automation)
- CI/CD, OTA, and infrastructure for embedded platforms
- IoT & industrial automation

## Public Repositories

Public repositories contain **demos, simulations, and architectural patterns**.  
Client, employer, and production code is **private by design**.
